## Next Steps

After setting up and running the project, here are some next steps you can take:

1. User Registration: Start by creating a new user account. Navigate to the signup page and register with your email and password.

2. User Login: Once registered, log in to the system using your credentials.

3. Create Invoices: After logging in, you can start creating new invoices. Click on the "Create New Invoice" button and fill in the required details.

4. Manage Invoices: You can view all your created invoices on the home page. From here, you can:
   - Edit existing invoices
   - Delete invoices
   - Sort invoices by date or amount
   - Filter invoices by status (Paid, Unpaid, Pending)

5. Explore the API: If you're a developer, you can explore the API endpoints mentioned in the "API Endpoints" section. Try making requests to these endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.

6. Customize the UI: If you want to modify the user interface, you can edit the React components in the `src/components` directory.

7. Extend Functionality: Consider adding new features to the system, such as:
   - Generating PDF invoices
   - Implementing email notifications
   - Adding a dashboard with invoice statistics

8. Testing: Write and run tests for both the frontend and backend to ensure the reliability of the system.

9. Deployment: When you're ready, deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS).

Remember to regularly commit your changes to version control as you work on these next steps.
